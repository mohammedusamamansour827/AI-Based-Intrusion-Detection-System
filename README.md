# 🛡️ NetSec – AI-Powered Real-Time Network Defense

A lightweight, intelligent, and scalable SIEM-like solution that provides real-time network traffic classification using **Suricata**, **XGBoost**, and a **Flask-based dashboard**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

NetSec started as a basic vulnerability matcher but evolved into a real-time, multi-host traffic analysis platform. It integrates **Suricata NIDS**, **custom socket-based log aggregation**, and **machine learning models** to detect and classify malicious activity across a distributed network.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🔁 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collects Suricata logs from multiple hosts continuously.  
- 🧠 **Binary & Multi-Class Classification**: Detects malicious traffic and identifies the type of attack (DDoS, Botnet, PortScan, etc.).  
- ⚙️ **Socket-Based Log Transfer**: Clients send logs to a centralized server via a custom socket system.  
- 📊 **Flask Web Dashboard**: Provides interactive visualizations, log browsing, and result summaries.  
- 🧪 **Hybrid Detection**: Combines Suricata’s signature-based alerts with ML-powered classification.  
- 💡 **Lightweight SIEM**: Simulates core functions of a Security Information and Event Management system for small networks or research environments.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

| Model File                     | Description                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `XGBoost_binary_retrained.pkl` | Detects if traffic is malicious or benign |
| `XGBoost_multi_retrained.pkl`  | Classifies type of attack (multi-class)   |
| `label_encoder_multi_retrained.pkl` | Converts prediction to readable label   |

- Trained on: [CICIDS2017 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) + real-world traffic  
- Performance: High accuracy (>97%) with minimal false positives
